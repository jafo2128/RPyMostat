RPyMostat
=========

[![Project Status: Concept - Minimal or no implementation has been done yet.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/concept.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

A python-based intelligent home thermostat, targeted at (but not requiring) the RaspberryPi and similar small computers.

I've really only started some proof-of-concept work for some parts of this (see the [PoC branch](https://github.com/jantman/RaspberryPyMostat/tree/PoC) for that).
