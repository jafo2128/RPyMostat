RPyMostat
=========

[![Project Status: Concept - Minimal or no implementation has been done yet.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/concept.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

A python-based intelligent home thermostat, targeted at (but not requiring) the RaspberryPi and similar small computers.

I've really only started some proof-of-concept work for some parts of this (see the [PoC branch](https://github.com/jantman/RPyMostat/tree/PoC) for that).

See:

* [Architecture.md](Architecture.md) for an overview of the architecture, and most of the documentation that currently exists.

ToDo
----

* sphinx docs (and gh-pages for the site)
* figure out packaging

Packaging
---------

I'm still trying to figure out how to package all of this.
